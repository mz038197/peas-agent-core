description: This skill should be used for any request involving search, lookup, fact-finding, current information, or web-based retrieval. Always use this repository's felo-cli tools first (CLI/SDK), with direct API calls as a fallback reference.
always: true

Use this skill for any task that involves searching, querying external information, looking up current facts, checking dates, verifying public information, or otherwise retrieving information beyond the local workspace. This includes requests such as「幫我查一下…」、「搜尋…」、「最新資訊」、「今年是什麼時候」、「哪裡可以找到…」等。

Rule: if the user request is related to search in any way, prefer this skill first.

Prefer project tools in this order:

1. CLI: `npx -y @willh/felo-cli --json "<query>"` (always use `--json` when retrieving content so the full structured output is preserved).
2. SDK: `createFeloClient()` / `feloChat()` from `src/felo-client.ts` when programmatic integration is needed.
3. Direct API call only when validating protocol-level behavior.

For direct HTTP reference, use `POST https://openapi.felo.ai/v2/chat` with:

- Environment variable: `FELO_API_KEY`
- `Authorization: Bearer <FELO_API_KEY>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- Body `{ "query": "<string>" }` where `query` is 1..2000 characters

Handle success/error payloads and rate-limit headers using [references/api-contract.md](references/api-contract.md) and [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md).
